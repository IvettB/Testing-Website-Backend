Lab 4

## Executive Summary:
This lab implements a RESTful API and allows the user to create and interact with a Todo list using HTTP requests. 
The data is stored in MongoDB using Atlas, a document database hosted in the cloud. 
Unit tests are also included to diagnose issues and test functionality. 

## Design Overview:
The following UML diagram shows the basic architecture of the web API. 
The swim lanes in the UML show what components interact with each other, and how the different objects communicate between the front- and backend.
